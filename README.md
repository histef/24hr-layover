# Neighborhood Map Project

This is the final project for the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree. I was tasked to create a web app completely from scratch using React. The app:

* displays a map (using an API of my choosing)
* with markers that point to a specific location
* and infowindows that contain more information(using a different API)
* there is also a searchfield/selection menu
* caches information using a service worker
* responsive
* accessible


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
